# Project Agent Rules (Aurora Capture)

This project is actively maintained by a human owner.
The agent must follow these rules strictly.

## General Principles
- Do not modify any files without explicit user confirmation
- Prefer minimal, controlled changes over large refactors
- This is not a refactoring task unless explicitly stated

## Before Coding
- Always summarize your understanding of the task
- List all files you plan to modify or create
- Wait for user confirmation before writing any code

## Code Modification Rules
- Use full function or full block replacement
- Do NOT insert scattered lines into existing code
- Do NOT perform "incidental improvements"
- Do NOT rename variables, functions, or files unless asked

## Scope Control
- Only modify files explicitly approved by the user
- If you think a better solution exists, explain it first and wait

## Language
- User instructions may be written in Chinese
- Keep code, APIs, and technical terms in English
